#summary Manual for PW chat

= Installation =

 * Download PW Chat from [https://code.google.com/p/pw-chat/downloads/list here] or checkout the source from [https://code.google.com/p/pw-chat/source/checkout here]
 * Read the included README.txt file for some notes about PW Chat
 * Open up the pwchat-server directory and then open csharp.php (this can be renamed later)
 * Change any of these settings if you want (I HIGHLY recommend you change the authkey)

 * Scroll down a little bit and edit the SQL settings to match your server. You may use the dbo database that pwAdmin and the PWServer uses if you wish.

 * If you get a syntax error it means you need to update your PHP version ([http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53632 PHP Bug #53632])

 * Save and close csharp.php (you may rename this to anything you want, but remember its name)
 * Open users.php settings here should be self explanatory (comments describe what is going on)
